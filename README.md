# About the project...
<div>
  <p>
    On the backend, I created the User, Post, Comment and Like services and wrote the adding, deleting, updating and data extraction procedures for each service. I used DTO as response and   request for each service.

Using Spring Security, I created a token with JWT that allows each user to log in for a certain period of time and restricts some service methods. Thus, anyone who is not logged in will not be able to comment or like the post.

    I also made object transformations using the constructor and converter in the response classes.
